# Food World Project

## Project Description
Food World is a web application that showcases a variety of delicious recipes from different cuisines around the world. The project provides users with a smooth and interactive experience to explore recipes, rate dishes, switch between light and dark modes, and manage user preferences. The application includes features like a responsive design, interactive navigation, and a toggleable theme for enhanced accessibility.

## Key Features

### 1. User Authentication
- **Login/Logout**: Users can log in to access personalized features and log out to end their session.
- **Session Persistence**: The application maintains the login state across different pages, providing a seamless experience.

### 2. Light/Dark Mode
- **Theme Toggle**: Users can switch between light and dark themes by clicking a toggle button.
- **User Preference Storage**: The chosen theme (light or dark mode) is saved as a preference, allowing the theme to persist across page reloads.

### 3. Recipe Rating System
- **Interactive Rating**: Users can rate each recipe with a 5-star rating system.
- **Visual Feedback**: Star ratings are color-coded for easy user interaction and feedback.

### 4. Responsive Design
- **Optimized Layout**: The application is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Consistent Navigation**: The navigation bar design is unified across all pages for a cohesive look and feel.

### 5. Enhanced User Experience
- **Notification Sound**: A button allows users to play a notification sound, adding a layer of interactivity.
- **Form Validation**: User input fields include validation to ensure correct data entry.

## User Preferences
The application remembers user preferences (like theme selection) through session-based storage. This allows users to continue their browsing experience without having to reset their theme choice every time they refresh or navigate through the pages.
